Feature: Independent Payment Strategy
  As a service provider
  in order to provide an a-la-carte menu of products and consistent charges
  I want to offer independent payments & subscriptions for each product

  Scenario Outline: Adding a product
    Given I support Independent Payment Strategy
    And   Today is 3/15/12
    And   I don't have any subscriptions
    When  I change to having: <added products>
    Then  I expect the following action: <action>
  Examples:
    | added products         | action                                                 |
    | A @ $30/mo             | add A @ $30/mo on 03/15/12                             |
    | A @ $30/mo, B @ $40/mo | add A @ $30/mo on 03/15/12, add B @ $40/mo on 03/15/12 |
